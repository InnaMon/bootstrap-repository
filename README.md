# Reflection
This was a personal project that I created for a friend that enabled me to put my front-end development skills to use. 
I created the backbone using Bootstrap 4 and added custom html/css markup and vanilla JS where necessary.
I used the mailchimp marketing platform to allow the customer to sign up for emails and communicate with the business.
I also made sure the site followed Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and included WAI-ARIA attributes to HTML elements, 
enhancing assistive technologies.
